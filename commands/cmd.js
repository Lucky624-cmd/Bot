Make Sure to subscribe.\n "ping", this is a basic command for preparing me. if you want to ping someone please use this so that the bot will also say something.\n At last there is two more commands that you can use. "prefix", and "aboutme". prefix command will say me how to interact with me with a single letter make sure to check that out.\n aboutme command tells about me and how i was created.
